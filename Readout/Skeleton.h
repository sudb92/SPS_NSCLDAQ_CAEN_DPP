/*
** This file is a skeleton for the production readout software for
** NSCLDAQ 10.0 and later.  The programmatic interface
** to NSCLDAQ 10.0 at the application level is a 'close match' to that
** of earlier versions.  The software itself is a complete re-write so
** some incompatibilities may exist.  If you find an incompatibility,
** please post it at daqbugs.nscl.msu.edu so that it can be documented,
** and addressed.  Note that this does not necessarily mean that
** the incompatibility will be 'fixed'.
**
**   ------------------------------------------------------------
**
** How to use this skeleton:
**
**  This skeleton is the 'application' class for the production readout software.
**  The application class has several member functions you can override
**  and implement to perform user specific initialization.
**  These are:
**    AddCommands         - Extend the Tcl interpreter with additional commands.
**    SetupRunVariables   - Creates an initial set of run variables.
**    SetupStateVariables - Creates an initial set of state variables.
**    SetupReadout        - Sets up the software's trigger and its response to 
**                          that trigger.
**    SetupScalers        - Sets up the response to the scaler trigger and, if desired,
**                          modifies the scaler trigger from a periodic trigger controlled
**                          by the 'frequency' Tcl variable to something else.
**
** For more information about how to tailor this skeleton, see
** the comments in Skeleton.cpp
