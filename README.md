----------------

	+ Borrows from the ReadNSCLDAQFiles framework in http://docs.nscl.msu.edu/daq/newsite/nscldaq-11.4/c4826.html
	+ Abstract class CFragmentHandler inherits to class CDppFragmentHandler which can hold/return a DppEvent
	+ CDppFragmentHandler inherits to CPSDFragmentHandler and CPHAFragmentHandler
	+ The unique size for PSD and PHA fragments is used by CRawUnpacker.cpp to distinguish them with 	CRingItemDecoder
	+ TODO: PSD Fine timestamp lives in 'Extras'- Needs better implementation before testing with focalplane signals
	+ Run as ./SpecTcl 

scalerDisplay
